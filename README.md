# Stress-Detection-Using-an-Out-of-Fold-OOF-Stacked-Ensemble-of-ML-and-Deep-Learning-Models
An M.Tech-level stress detection system using an Out-of-Fold (OOF) stacked ensemble of LightGBM, CNN, LSTM, and BiLSTM. Cross-validated OOF predictions are used to train a LightGBM meta-learner, ensuring no data leakage and robust, generalizable stress classification.
